# Stage: incident and recovered (a side path from any active stage)

Enter here when something failed, behaves unexpectedly, or the record and reality may
disagree. Append a `stage_change` to `incident` first.

1. **Read the state first**, then re-verify live facts before acting: what is actually
   running, reachable and configured now. Mark facts STALE when they may no longer hold,
   and UNKNOWN when you cannot tell.
2. **Reconcile.** A resource that exists but is missing from the record gets added, with
   its origin and a fact. A resource in the record that is gone gets its lifecycle and fact
   updated. Never delete something just to make the record tidy.
3. **Separate diagnosis from established fact.** A cause you infer is ASSUMED (source
   reasoning), with the evidence you read. Only a check that proves it makes it verified.
4. **Decide the fix.** If it changes the plan, append `plan_failure`. If it needs a gate
   (deletion, something destructive, extra cost), request a decision and wait.
5. **Fix** with an `intent` and a `result`, as in any other stage.
6. When the failure is resolved, append a `stage_change` to `recovered`. Then go
   back to verifying (another `stage_change`) and re-check every affected layer:
   recovered is not verified.

## After an interruption

A session can end mid-step, and a killed AI may record nothing. Whoever notices the
interruption, at the last moment it can write or at resume, records it in the existing
fields: `handoff.last_safe_state` (the last state known good), `activity` (what was running,
`waiting_on`) and `next` (the first check and its owner). On resume, first find any `intent`
without a matching `result` and check its target live. Never redo the last step blind.

Add anything that stays fragile to `handoff.fragile`.

Never create a second state or a second workspace. Repair the one you have.

## Always (from the router)

- Never write a secret value into the record, evidence, logged commands or git.
- Re-verify the facts an action depends on before any write.
- Around every remote-mutating command, gated action or long operation: an `intent` event
  before it and a `result` event after it.
- Use only the seven statuses. Your own claim is never verified without evidence.
- Gates sit at stage boundaries. Ask once when no action separates two gates;
  the plan explanation travels with the first billable request.
